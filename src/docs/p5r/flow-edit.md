# How to edit Flowscript files

## Intro

Atlus games use a proprietary set of commpiled binary file formats that can store both code and text. (BF and BMD)

Thanks to the efforts by the modding community, tools have been developed to decompile both of these formats into a readable form (.flow and .msg)

## Tools needed

There are a couple tools you need to open BF and BMD files:

[AtlusScriptToolchain](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/Atlus-Script-Tools/releases) by TGE

[AtlusScriptToolchainGUI](https://github.com/ShrineFox/AtlusScriptCompiler-GUI/releases/) by ShrineFox

Any text editor (such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or even the default Windows Notepad)

## Opening up files

To edit a .BF or a .BMD, open the GUI app

There's a few settings that need to be adjusted, mainly the game encoding. In this case we want to set it to Persona 5 Royal.

After that we're all set! Now we can drag and drop .BF and .BMD files on the first square to decompile them and .flow and .msg files on the second square to recompile them into .BF or .BMD
