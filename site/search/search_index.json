Find the texture you want to edit. As an example: Lets say you want to edit Ann's hair. Go to the P5R page on the Amicitia Wiki and navigate to the Character Models section. Find Ann in the list of characters and open her page. Find the model you want to edit. I'll go with her default Metaverse attire, so c0004_051_00.GMD . Character models are located in MODEL/CHARACTER/<ID>/ , so in this case MODEL/CHARACTER/0004/c0004_051_00.GMD . Open the model using GFDStudio . You'll see a view like this: Navigate to the Textures section by clicking on the + icon next to the file's name. You should see this: Now we need to find the texture we want. Luckly GFDStudio can preview them directly. In this case its c0004_t01_hair01b_low.dds Right click on the texture's name and choose export. NOT EXPORT AS YAML, JUST EXPORT. Make sure you export as .dds and not .png Now what you want to do is load this dds inside of an image editing software. Photoshop works by using either Intel's or NVIDIA's Texture Works plugins, or you can use GIMP . After having made your edits, save the image as .png WITH TRANSPARENCY ENABLED. After that, using NVTT (Nvidia Texture Tools) you can convert your png to BC7 DDS. Use these settings: When clicking on Save As... make sure to end the file's name in .dds After you've converted the texture successfully, you can right click on the texture in GFDStudio and click Replace. Navigate to your texture and open the file. It'll take a bit depending on the texture's size but you should be able to preview how the texture looks on the model inside GFDStudio. If you're happy with the results you can hit CTRL+SHIFT+S to save as a new .gmd file ( to avoid overwriting the vanilla files ). You can now place this gmd inside of your mod's folder. eg. /P5REssentials/CPK/TEXTUREDIT/MODEL/CHARACTER/0004/C0004_051_00.GMD And you're done! If you boot the game now you should be able to see your edits! Extra If you want to replace a texture that is common on a bunch of models, you can use this GFDStudio build that adds the ability to Mass Import and Export textures. You select a directory containing .GMDs and a directory containing textures and it'll automatically replace those textures in all models.
